# Scittle ClojureScript

I would like you to work on a simple web app using Scittle, a ClojureScript interpreter for the browser.

- Scittle does not include the `goog` namespace or closure libraries so you will have to fall back on vanilla JavaScript browser functions and methods.
- You can use libraries from cdnjs by including them in a script tag and using them with the `js/` prefix as needed. Scittle largely follows ClojureScript conventions.

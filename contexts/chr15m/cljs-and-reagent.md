# ClojureScript and Reagent

You are an expert ClojureScript developer.

You will be working on a code base containing ClojureScript.

The Reagent library is available for rendering the interface with React.
Strongly prefer Reagent style data manipulation and native Clojure functions and macros such as `swap!` instead of React functions like `useEffect`.

Please don't use outdated React lifecycle hooks like `:component-did-mount` - instead you should prefer the `:ref` attribute which takes a function that is passed a dom element when it is mounted `nil` when it is unmounted.
You can replace lifecycle hooks with this.
The outdated `rdom/dom-node` function is now DEPRECATED.
Please use the element passed to the `:ref` function directly as it is already a dom node.
You can also use `js/document.querySelector` to access dom nodes directly.

ALWAYS use the most current Reagent and ClojureScript best practices, avoiding deprecated methods and lifecycle hooks.

Extract the tabular data on this page as csv. Respond with only the content of the csv file without any additional text.

Ignore any linebreaks in the table cells. Make sure to quote every cell value.
When encountering empty cells, provide an empty string as value.

You must extract ALL the information available in the entire document.

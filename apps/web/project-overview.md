# ctxs.ai: Context Registry for LLMs

## What is ctxs.ai?

ctxs.ai is an open-source, community-curated registry for context windows, prompts, and other content used with Large Language Models (LLMs). It serves as a central hub where developers and AI practitioners can share, discover, and utilize context files to enhance LLM performance for various tasks, primarily focused on software and product development use cases.

## Why ctxs.ai Exists

As Simon Willison puts it, "Context is King" when working with LLMs. While these models provide a new form of intelligence, they often lack specific context about our projects, systems, toolchains, and coding conventions. 

ctxs.ai addresses this challenge by:

1. Creating a community-driven platform where users can share effective context files
2. Providing a permanent repository for context windows and prompts
3. Allowing developers to vote on and discover the most useful contexts
4. Making it easy to integrate these contexts into development workflows

## Goals of ctxs.ai

The primary goals of the project are to:

- Build a comprehensive library of reusable context files for common development scenarios
- Foster a community of practitioners sharing best practices for LLM interactions
- Standardize how context files are shared, versioned, and referenced
- Simplify the integration of context rules into development workflows
- Improve LLM performance across various tools and platforms through better context

## How ctxs.ai Works

### Content Sharing and Discovery

Users can:
- Upload various types of context files (coding conventions, documentation, Cursor Rules, project structures, etc.)
- Tag content with relevant categories
- Vote on the most useful contexts each week
- Browse content by tag or discover weekly top-rated submissions

### Permalinks System

Each context rule receives a unique URN (Uniform Resource Name) in the format:
```
urn:ctxs:[namespace]:[username]:[id]
```

These permalinks ensure that context files can be:
- Accessed consistently over time
- Shared easily with the community
- Referenced reliably in documentation
- Integrated with tools and workflows using stable URLs

### CLI Integration

The project provides a CLI tool that allows users to:
- Add context rules directly to their codebases
- Seamlessly integrate with development workflows
- Import and manage context files with simple commands
- Specifically support Cursor rules integration

### Cursor Rules Support

The platform has special support for Cursor rules, which are configuration files that help AI assistants better understand codebases by providing context and guidelines about project structure, coding standards, and best practices.

## Community Aspects

ctxs.ai emphasizes community involvement through:
- GitHub issue tracking for feature requests and bug reports
- Social media presence on X/Twitter and Bluesky for weekly roundups
- Open contribution model for context files
- Voting system to surface the most valuable content

## Future Development

The project continues to evolve with planned features including:
- Content update capabilities
- MCP server integration
- Enhanced tagging systems
- Expanded tool integration beyond Cursor

# Questions & Answers

## What is this?

ctxs.ai is a registry and community site to share context windows, prompts and anything else you'd feed to an LLM. It's primarily aimed at software-/product development type use cases but you are welcome to use it for anything.

## Can I update a context after I posted it?

Not yet. We want to implement this in a way that recognizes the challenges of prompt injection attacks and aren't need to explore the specific implementation more.

## Where can I request features or report issues?

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ctxs-ai/ctxs.ai/issues) on our GitHub repo.

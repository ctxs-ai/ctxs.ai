# Why Contribute?

LLMs provide us with a new form of intelligence but it is an intelligence that often lacks context. Knowledge about our projects, systems toolchains etc.

This knowledge can be provided to LLMs in the form of context and that is what you can share and discover on ctxs. For the lack of a better word let's call this *context files*.

As Simon Willison puts it, [Context is King](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#context-is-king).

## What to contribute

ctxs.ai is an attempt to allow the community to come together and share context files. Context files can be many things:

- Coding conventions
- Markdown files with documentation
- Cursor Rules files
- Project structures

Your creativity is the limit!
